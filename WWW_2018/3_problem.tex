\section{Problem Formulation} 
In this section we describe the requirements for designing a model to understand the successes and failures of knowledge markets. Since content generation and consumption is the key means to measure a knowledge markets' success or failure, we aim to build a model to better understand the content generation dynamics. Specifically, we opt for a model with the following desired properties.

%To better understand the content generation dynamics and subsequent success/failure of a knowledge market, we opt for a model with the following desired properties.

\textbf{Macro-scale.} The model should capture content generation dynamics at aggregate level. 

\textbf{Explanatory.} The model should give us some deeper understanding of how an aggregate knowledge market behaves.

\textbf{Predictive.} The model should allow us to make predictions about future content generation and resultant success or failure.

\textbf{Minimalistic.} The model should have as few parameters as necessary, and still closely reflect the observed reality.

\textbf{Comprehensive.} The model should encompass content generation dynamics for different content types (e.g., question, answer, comment) in varieties of knowledge markets.

In remaining sections we propose models that meet the aforementioned requirements, and show that our best-fit model accurately reflects the content generation dynamics and resultant successes and failures of many real-world knowledge markets.
