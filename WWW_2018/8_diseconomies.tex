\section{Diseconomies of Scale}
In this section we discuss the diseconomies of scale that occur in the knowledge markets.

\subsection{Empirical Observation}
Backed by the diminishing returns, Stack Exchange websites undergo diseconomies of scale---the ratio of answers to questions go down with the increase in number of users. We compare the economic curves with logistic curves to justify effectiveness in capturing diseconomies of scale. \textcolor{blue}{Figure: Plot to show answer to question ratio vs number of users fit for economic and logistic curves.}

\subsection{Decline in Health} 
As the health of knowledge markets directly depend on content generation, we investigate the effect of scale on a set of health metrics. \textcolor{blue}{Figure: Plot to show correlation between answer to question ratio and health metrics}

\subsection{Decline in Stability} 
As the stability of knowledge markets depend on user participation, we investigate the effect of scale on stability. \textcolor{blue}{Figure: Plot to show stability as a function of economic parameters/size/etc.}
