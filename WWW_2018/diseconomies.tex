\section{Diseconomies of Scale}
\subsection{Empirical Observation}
Backed by the diminishing returns, Stack Exchange websites undergo diseconomies of scale--- the ratio of answers to questions go down with the increase in number of users. We compare the economic curves with logistic curves to justify effectiveness in capturing diseconomies of scale. \textcolor{blue}{Figure: Plot to show answer to question ratio vs number of users fit for economic and logistic curves.}

\subsection{Decline in Health} As the survival of CQA platforms directly depend on content generation, we investigate the adverse effect of scale on a set of health metrics. \textcolor{blue}{Figure: Plot to show correlation between answer to question ratio and health metrics}

\subsection{Decline in Stability} The stability of CQA platforms also depend on user activity distribution. We investigate the stability of different Stack Exchange websites. \textcolor{blue}{Figure: Plot to show stability as a function of economic parameters/size/etc.}

\subsection{Affect on Controllability} The controllability of CQA platforms also depend on user activity distribution. We investigate the controllability of different Stack Exchange websites. \textcolor{blue}{Figure: Plot to show controllability as a function of economic parameters/size/etc.}
