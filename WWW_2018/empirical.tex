\section{Empirical Analysis}

\subsection{Dataset Description} 
Number of websites, time period and other relevant description.

\subsection{Parameter Estimation} 
How we estimate the parameters of our models.

\subsection{Model Fitting Results} 
Best fit models and parameters for different Stack Exchange websites. \textcolor{blue}{Figure: Boxplot to compare the fitting results for different models.}

\subsection{Forecasting Content Generation} 
The effectiveness of our model in content prediction task. \textcolor{blue}{Figure: Bar chart to show prediction accuracy for different models along with one or two line charts showing prediction for sample Stack Exchange websites.}

\subsection{Parameter Estimation for New Websites} We use parameter distributions learnt from old Stack Exchange websites as prior distributions for new Stack Exchange websites. \textcolor{blue}{Figure: Plot to compare the posteriors learnt using transfer learning with the posteriors learnt using more data points in future (bar chart).}

\subsection{Sensitivity to Time Granularity} 
The effectiveness study of our model under different time granularity, e.g., day, week, month, quarter. \textcolor{blue}{Figure: Plot to show prediction accuracy for different time granularity (bar chart)}
