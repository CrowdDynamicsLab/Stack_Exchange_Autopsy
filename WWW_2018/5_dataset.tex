\section{Dataset} 
We collected the latest release (September, 2017) of Stack Exchange dataset. This snapshot is a complete archive of all activities in all Stack Exchange. There are 169 sites in our collected dataset. For the purpose of empirical analysis, we only consider the sites that have been active for at least 12 months beyond the ramp up period (site created, but few or no activity). There are 156 such sites. The age of these sites vary from 14 months to 111 months, number of user from 1072 to 547175, number of posts (questions and answers) from 1600 to 1985869. Further, the sites have small overlaps in user base; therefore, we can reasonably argue that the underlying markets are independent. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:dataset} we present letter value plots (in log-scale) to show the distribution of number of users, number of posts, and age for the Stack Exchange markets.
